# üöÄ Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get your Tower Blocks AVAX game running.

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

3. Click "Create New Project"
4. Name it "Tower Blocks AVAX"
5. Copy your Project ID (starts with something like `a1b2c3d4...`)

### Update Configuration

Open `lib/wagmi-config.ts` and replace the placeholder:

```typescript
// BEFORE:
projectId: 'YOUR_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID',

// AFTER:
projectId: 'a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6',  // Your actual ID
```

## Step 3: Set Up Avalanche Fuji Testnet

3. Click "Add Network"
4. Click "Add a network manually"
5. Fill in these details:

```
Network Name:        Avalanche Fuji C-Chain
New RPC URL:         https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc

## Step 4: Deploy Smart Contract

### Using Remix IDE (Easiest)

2. **Create Contract File**
   - In File Explorer (left panel), click the "+" icon
   - Name the file: `TowerBlocksGame.sol`
   - Click on the file to open it
   - Copy the entire contract from `contracts/TowerBlocksGame.sol`
   - Paste into Remix editor

3. **Compile Contract**
   - Click "Solidity Compiler" icon (2nd icon on left)
   - Select compiler version: `0.8.20` or higher
   - Enable "Auto compile" (optional but helpful)
   - Click "Compile TowerBlocksGame.sol"
   - Wait for green checkmark ‚úÖ

4. **Deploy to Fuji**
   - Click "Deploy & Run Transactions" icon (3rd icon on left)
   - Under "ENVIRONMENT", select "Injected Provider - MetaMask"
   - MetaMask popup will appear - click "Connect"
   - **IMPORTANT**: Verify MetaMask is on "Avalanche Fuji" network
   - Under "CONTRACT", ensure "TowerBlocksGame" is selected
   - Click orange "Deploy" button
   - MetaMask popup: Review transaction (~0.01 AVAX gas)
   - Click "Confirm"
   - Wait for deployment (~2-3 seconds)

5. **Copy Contract Address**
   - Look under "Deployed Contracts" section (bottom of right panel)
   - You'll see "TOWERBLOCKSGAME AT 0x..."
   - Click the copy icon next to the address
   - Save this address - you'll need it!

6. **Update Your Code**
   - Open `lib/contract-abi.ts` in your code editor
   - Find the `CONTRACT_ADDRESSES` object
   - Replace the Fuji address:

   ```typescript
   export const CONTRACT_ADDRESSES = {
     43113: '0xYourContractAddressHere', // ‚Üê Paste your address
     43114: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
   };
   ```

   - Save the file

## Step 5: Test Your Setup

### Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Expected output**:
```
‚ñ≤ Next.js 15.0.0
- Local:        http://localhost:3000
- Network:      http://192.168.x.x:3000

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Module not found" errors

**Solution:**
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Issue: Wallet won't connect

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Is MetaMask unlocked?
- [ ] Are you on Fuji network?
- [ ] Did you add Project ID to wagmi-config.ts?
- [ ] Try clearing browser cache
- [ ] Try different browser

### Issue: Transaction fails

**Possible causes:**
1. **Insufficient AVAX**: Get more from faucet
2. **Wrong network**: Switch to Fuji in MetaMask
3. **Wrong contract address**: Double-check in contract-abi.ts
4. **Gas too low**: Try again, MetaMask will estimate

### Issue: Leaderboard empty

**This is normal!** Leaderboard will populate as players submit scores.

**To test:**
- Play a game with wallet connected
- Game will auto-submit score
- Refresh page to see updated leaderboard

### Issue: Game canvas not rendering

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Try clearing localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
3. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
4. Try different browser (Chrome recommended)

### Issue: Extra life modal doesn't appear

**Check:**
1. Is wallet connected?
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify contract is deployed
4. Make sure you're on the correct network

## Next Steps

### For Development

1. **Customize the game**
   - Edit `components/TowerBlocks.tsx`
   - Change colors, speeds, difficulty
   - Add new features

2. **Modify smart contract**
   - Edit `contracts/TowerBlocksGame.sol`
   - Change extra life price
   - Add new functions
   - Redeploy to get new address

3. **Style the UI**
   - Edit `app/page.tsx` for layout
   - Modify `app/globals.css` for styles
   - Update `components/Leaderboard.tsx`

### For Production

1. **Test thoroughly on Fuji testnet**
   - Play many games
   - Test with different wallets
   - Have friends test it

2. **Deploy to mainnet** (when ready)
   - Follow DEPLOYMENT.md guide
   - Will cost real AVAX (~0.1-0.2 for deployment)
   - Update contract address for chain ID 43114

3. **Deploy frontend**
   - See DEPLOYMENT.md for Vercel/Netlify steps
   - Connect custom domain
